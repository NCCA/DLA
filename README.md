# Diffusion Limited Aggregation

A series of [DLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation) examples I use in class for teaching. 

Whilst we usually build these from scratch in the class, these examples are my finished / working versions used as reference and for other projects.
